    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>This learn module is based on historic investment data from the IEA's World Energy Investment 2020 report(https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-investment-2020), which are downscaled to individual technology and countries by using BP's 2020 data as weights (https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html). The scenario data comes from the CD-Links study(https://www.cd-links.org/), as presented in the paper McCollum et al. 2018(McCollum, David L., Wenji Zhou, Christoph Bertram, Harmen-Sytze de Boer, Valentina Bosetti, Sebastian Busch, Jacques Després, et al. “Energy Investment Needs for Fulfilling the Paris Agreement and Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.” Nature Energy 3, no. 7 (July 2018): 589–99. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-018-0179-z.). Given that especially the renewables assumption in the CD-Links study are somewhat outdated for many of the models (less so for the REMIND-MAgPIE model which is therefore shown as default), we plan to update the learn module with new scenario data from the ENGAGE project (http://www.engage-climate.org/) that will become available during Q1 or Q2 of 2021.</p>
