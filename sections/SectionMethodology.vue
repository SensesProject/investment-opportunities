    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>This learn module is based on historic investment data from the IEA’s <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-investment-2020" target="_blank">World Energy Investment 2020 report</a>, which are downscaled to individual technology and countries by using BP’s <a href="https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html" target="_blank">2020 data</a> as weights. The scenario data comes from the <a href="https://www.cd-links.org/" target="_blank">CD-Links study</a>, as presented in the paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-018-0179-z." target="_blank" v-tooltip="{ content: '<p>McCollum, David L., Wenji Zhou, Christoph Bertram, Harmen-Sytze de Boer, Valentina Bosetti, Sebastian Busch, Jacques Després, et al. “Energy Investment Needs for Fulfilling the Paris Agreement and Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.” Nature Energy 3, no. 7 (July 2018): 589–99.</p>'}">McCollum et al. 2018</a>. Given that especially the renewables assumption in the CD-Links study are somewhat outdated for many of the models (less so for the REMIND-MAgPIE model which is therefore shown as default), we plan to update the learn module with new scenario data from the <a href="http://www.engage-climate.org/" target="_blank">ENGAGE project</a> that will become available during Q1 or Q2 of 2021.</p>
